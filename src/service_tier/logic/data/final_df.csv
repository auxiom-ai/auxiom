A Survey on Audio Diffusion Models: Text To Speech Synthesis and Enhancement in Generative AI,"Generative AI has demonstrated impressive performance in various fields, among which speech synthesis is an interesting direction. With the diffusion model as the most popular generative model, numerous works have attempted two active tasks: text to speech and speech enhancement. This work conducts a survey on audio diffusion model, which is complementary to existing surveys that either lack the recent progress of diffusion-based speech synthesis or highlight an overall picture of applying diffusion model in multiple fields. Specifically, this work first briefly introduces the background of audio and diffusion model. As for the text-to-speech task, we divide the methods into three categories based on the stage where diffusion model is adopted: acoustic model, vocoder and end-to-end framework. Moreover, we categorize various speech enhancement tasks by either certain signals are removed or added into the input speech. Comparisons of experimental results and discussions are also covered in this survey.",arXiv.org,"Chenshuang Zhang, Chaoning Zhang, Sheng Zheng, Mengchun Zhang, Maryam Qamar, S.

Synthetic Data Generation: A Comparative Study,"Generating synthetic data similar to realistic data is a crucial task in data augmentation and data production. Due to the preservation of authentic data distribution, synthetic data provide concealment of sensitive information and therefore enable Big Data acquisition for model training without facing privacy challenges. Nevertheless, the obstacles arise starting with acquiring real-world open-source data to effectively synthesizing new samples as genuine as possible. In this paper, a comparative study is conducted by considering the efficacy of different generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Data Synthesizer (DS), Synthetic Data Vault with Gaussian Copula (SDV-G), Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (SDV-GAN), and SynthPop Non-Parametric (SP-NP) approach to synthesize data with regard to various datasets. We used the pairwise correlation and Synthetic Data (SD) metrics as utility measures respectively between real data and generated data for evaluation. Accordingly, this paper investigates the effects of various data generation models, and the processing time of every model is included as one of the evaluation metrics.",International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium,"M.

Improving the Prosody of RNN-Based English Text-To-Speech Synthesis by Incorporating a BERT Model,"The prosody of currently available speech synthesis systems can be unnatural due to the systems only having access to the text, possibly enriched by linguistic information such as part-of-speech tags and parse trees. We show that incorporating a BERT model in an RNN-based speech synthesis model — where the BERT model is pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data, and ﬁne-tuned to the speech domain — improves prosody. Additionally, we propose a way of handling arbitrarily long sequences with BERT. Our ﬁndings indicate that small BERT models work better than big ones, and that ﬁne-tuning the BERT part of the model is pivotal for getting good results.",Interspeech,"Tom Kenter, Manish Sharma, R.

Advancing GUI for Generative AI: Charting the Design Space of Human-AI Interactions through Task Creativity and Complexity,"Technological progress has persistently shaped the dynamics of human-machine interactions in task execution. In response to the advancements in Generative AI, this paper outlines a detailed study plan that investigates various human-AI interaction modalities across a range of tasks, characterized by differing levels of creativity and complexity. This exploration aims to inform and contribute to the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that effectively integrate with and enhance the capabilities of Generative AI systems. The study comprises three parts: exploring fixed-scope tasks through news headline generation, delving into atomic creative tasks with analogy generation, and investigating complex tasks via data visualization. Future work aims to extend this exploration to linearize complex data analysis results into narratives understandable to a broader audience, thereby enhancing the interpretability of AI-generated content.",IUI Companion,Zijian Ding,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/985593908949db339427c852310c567ae8477b69,Generative AI Graphical User Interfaces Generative AI three AI progress dynamics machine interactions task execution response advancements paper study plan interaction modalities range tasks levels creativity complexity exploration development capabilities systems study parts scope tasks news headline generation tasks analogy generation tasks data visualization work exploration data analysis results narratives audience interpretability content,0.5493264
Intelligibility and naturalness of articulatory synthesis with VocalTractLab compared to established speech synthesis technologies,"In this work, the current state-of-the-art of articulatory speech synthesis (V OCAL T RACT L AB ) is compared to a wide range of different text-to-speech systems that once represented or still represent the continuously evolving state-of-the-art of speech synthesis technology. The comparison systems include neural and concatenative synthesis by Google and Microsoft, as well as Hidden Markov Model-based, unit-selection and diphone synthesis developed at universities (using M ARY TTS, MBROLA and DRESS). A small corpus of 15 German sentences was synthesized using the text-to-speech (and, if available, re-synthesis) functionalities of each system. The intelligibility of the synthesized utterances was evaluated in an ASR experiment. The naturalness of the utterances was evaluated in a multi-stimulus Likert test by 50 German native speakers. As an additional reference, recordings of natural speech were used in the experiments. It was found that the articulatory synthesis can achieve a performance on par with the non-commercial synthesis systems in terms of intelligibility and naturalness, while being signiﬁ-cantly outperformed by the commercial synthesis systems.",Speech Synthesis Workshop,"P.
