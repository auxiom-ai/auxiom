title_0,Natural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey
description_0,"TLDR: This survey reveals how giant leaps in Visual Question Answering (VQA) are fueled by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It breaks down how these models tackle VQA through clever image-to-text strategies, acting as central controllers orchestrating visual understanding, or even directly integrating visual info. The real game-changer? The survey shows how adding knowledge reasoning (from simple fact-checking to complex multi-hop logic) using LLMs significantly boosts VQA's ability to answer tough questions, pushing the field far beyond simple image recognition. Get ready to dive into a detailed exploration of the cutting-edge!"
title_1,A Review of Human Emotion Synthesis Based on Generative Technology
description_1,"TLDR: Want emotionally intelligent AI? This review dives deep into how generative models (GANs, Diffusion Models, LLMs, etc.) are creating realistic human emotions in faces, voices, and text. While impressive progress has been made, challenges remain in capturing nuanced emotions and evaluating synthetic feelings accurately. The future involves hybrid models, new sensory modalities, and applications thatâ€™ll revolutionize entertainment and human-computer interaction. Prepare to be amazed (and slightly creeped out)."
