Next Steps: the heavy packges on the client side can't be there, they ned to be language agnostic and we can't have a large libraries installed (minimal libraries) on the client side, it needs to be handleded by the server. don't need to work on the conversational inspect right now, want to make it possible using with millis, and want implementation on lambda and api gateway, and for now just streaming audio. the speech to text needs to be done on the server and just make it serverles with lambda and api gateway. 

I've implemented a bidirectional WebSocket-based communication system that extends the existing podcast streaming server with:

1. **Server-side Enhancements**:
   - Added a `ConversationContext` class for state management
   - Implemented Google's Gemini Pro model for natural language generation
   - Enhanced the WebSocket handler to support real-time turn-taking
   - Added conversation history tracking with a 5-message context window

2. **Client-side Implementation**:
   - Created a new `PodcastClient` class with WebSocket communication
   - Implemented speech recognition using Google's Speech-to-Text API
   - Added real-time audio processing with `sounddevice` and `pydub`
   - Implemented a thread-safe audio queue for synchronized playback
   - Added MP3 to WAV conversion pipeline for audio streaming

3. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Transitioned from unidirectional streaming to bidirectional communication
   - Added stateful conversation management
   - Implemented asynchronous audio processing
   - Added error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Integrated multiple AI services (OpenAI TTS, Google STT, Google Gemini)

The system now operates as a distributed real-time audio processing pipeline with natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
