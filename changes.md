I've implemented a bidirectional WebSocket-based communication system that extends the existing podcast streaming server with:

1. **Server-side Enhancements**:
   - Added a `ConversationContext` class for state management
   - Implemented Google's Gemini Pro model for natural language generation
   - Enhanced the WebSocket handler to support real-time turn-taking
   - Added conversation history tracking with a 5-message context window

2. **Client-side Implementation**:
   - Created a new `PodcastClient` class with WebSocket communication
   - Implemented speech recognition using Google's Speech-to-Text API
   - Added real-time audio processing with `sounddevice` and `pydub`
   - Implemented a thread-safe audio queue for synchronized playback
   - Added MP3 to WAV conversion pipeline for audio streaming

3. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Transitioned from unidirectional streaming to bidirectional communication
   - Added stateful conversation management
   - Implemented asynchronous audio processing
   - Added error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Integrated multiple AI services (OpenAI TTS, Google STT, Google Gemini)

The system now operates as a distributed real-time audio processing pipeline with natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
